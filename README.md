# Unmaintained

This was a course project, it is not in use and is not maintained, as such vulnnerable dependency alerts have been disabled.  This code should therefore be considered unsafe for use without dependency updates and general code review.

# Contacts Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

## Project Setup

* clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-complete.git`
* install the dependencies - `npm install`

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
